<h1 align=center><font size = 5> K-Nearest Neighbors Classification in R: Exercise </font></h1>

### Exercise 1: Balance Scale

In this exercise, we will be using the <font color = "green">balance_scale.txt</font> data set. In this data set, each data point is classified as having the balance scale tip to the right, tip to the left, or be balanced. The variables of the data set are 'left weight', 'left distance', 'right weight', and 'right distance'. The class is determined by the greater of (right-distance x right-weight) and (left-distance x left-weight). However, if these values are equal, the data point is balanced.

The objective of this exercise is to use the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to determine the classification of test data and to estimate using knn regression, the difference between the product of right-distance and right-weight, and the product of left-distance and left-weight.

### a). Install the package

We first install and load the libraries that will be used in this exercise.

```{r}
# Install the packages 'class' and 'kknn' and load their libraries, which will be needed for their k-nearest neighbors algorithms
install.packages("class")
install.packages("kknn")
library(class)
library(kknn)
```

### b). Download the data set, load the data and view its structure

We can use the download.file command to download the data set, <font color = "green">"balance_scale.txt"</font>, load the data using the read.csv command, and view its structure using the str command. We will also look at the first few lines of the data using the head command.

```{r}
# Load the data and view its structure
balance_scale <- read.csv("https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/684jzm7e6fbbssg87yc2v4dy53dgkdew.txt", sep = ",")
str(balance_scale)

# View the first few rows of the data using the head function
# Note: The raw data does not contain any column names
head(balance_scale)
```

### c). Clean the data
Now we will clean the data by adding column names, as well new columns for the right and left products and their differences.

```{r}
colnames(balance_scale) <- c("Class_Name","Left_Weight", "Left_Distance", "Right_Weight", "Right_Distance") head(balance_scale)
```

- [Hands-On Machine Learning with R](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/) by Bradley Boehmke & Brandon Greenwell

## Introduction
- Some example applications of ML
  1. Predicting the likelihood of a patient returning to the hospital.
  2. Segmenting customers based on certain attributes or purchasing behaviour.
  3. Predicting coupon redemption rates for a certain marketing campaign.
- Tasks that seek to learn from data.
- Use a certain set of *features* to train an algorithm *learner* and extract insights.
- Two main groups of algorithms or *learners*:
  1. Supervised algorithms or *learners*
  2. Unsupervised algorithms or *learners*.
  
## Supervised learning
- Predictive modeling
<blockquote>
... the process of developing a mathematical tool or a model that generates an accurate prediction. -- Kuhn and Johnson (2013)
</blockquote>
- $Y:$ target variable, dependent variable, response, outcome.
- $X:$ predictor, independent, attribute, feature, predictor.
- The *learning algorithm* in a *predictive model* models the relationship among the *target* and the *feature*.
- Examples:
  - Using *home attributes* to predict the *sales price*.
  - Using *patient attributes* to predict the risk of *readmission*.
- The above predicting models are examples of **supervised learning**.
  - In supervised learning the training data includes the *target* variable.
  - Two main categories of supervised learning:
    1. Regression
    2. Classification

## Regression problems
- **Regression problem:** The objective of the supervised learning is to predict a numerical outcome.
- The *target* variable is continuous. Example: Predicting home sales prices.

## Classification problems
- **Classification problem:** The objective of the supervised learning is to predict a categorical outcome.
- Predict a *binary* or *multinomial* response
  - Did a customer redeem a coupon? (Yes or No; 1 or 0)
  - Classify a customer review based on 1-5 LIKERT scale.
- Machine learning classification problems predict the *probability* of a particular class (yes or no), rather than the class itself.
  - By default the class with the highest predicted probability is the predicted class.
  
## Unsupervised learning
- Uses a set of statistical tools to better understand and describe the data.
- Analysis performed without a target variable.
- Identify groups in data.
- **Clustering**
  - Segment observations into similar groups.
  - Eg. divide customers into different homogeneous groups.
- **Dimension reduction** 
  - Reduce the number of variables in the dataset.
  - Eg. reduce the variable/feature set to a smaller set of uncorrelated variables as in linear regression.


## Data sets

- Property sales information as described in De Cock (2011).
  - problem type: supervised regression
  - response variable: Sale_Price (i.e., $195,000, $215,000)
  - features: 80
  - observations: 2,930
  - objective: use property attributes to predict the sale price of a home
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## install.packages("AmesHousing", dependencies = TRUE)
## ?AmesHousing::make_ames()
ames <- AmesHousing::make_ames()
```


---


- Employee attrition information originally provided by IBM Watson Analytics Lab.
  - problem type: supervised binomial classification
  - response variable: Attrition (i.e., “Yes”, “No”)
  - features: 30
  - observations: 1,470
  - objective: use employee attributes to predict if they will attrit (leave the company)
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## install.packages("modeldata")
data(attrition, package = "modeldata")
```

## Classifying based on similarities with *k*-nearest neighbours.

- The *k*-nearest neighbour algorithm uses labeled data and therefore it is a supervised learning algorithm.
- How does the kNN learn?
  - Examples of snakes in UK 
  - Two species of venomous snakes- grass snake and adder.
  - Slow worm - a limbless reptile mistaken for a snake.
- Objective: Build a kNN classifier to help you quickly classify future specimens you come across.
